<p>Model Reference Adaptive Control (MRAC) is one of the primary approaches to Adaptive Control. The basic idea of MRAC is to design a controller to make an uncertain nonlinear plant to follow a Reference model characterized by designed natural frequency and damping. We can define the nonlinear plant model (to be controlled!) as</p>
