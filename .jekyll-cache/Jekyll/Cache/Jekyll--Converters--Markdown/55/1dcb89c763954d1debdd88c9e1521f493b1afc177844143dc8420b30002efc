I"º<p>I am a PhD candidate at Department of Aerospace Engineering, University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign. My Research is direct towards exploring Sample Efficient Policy Transfer in Cross Domain tasks in RL, Information enabled Adaptive Control for Cyber-Physical Systems, Bayesian Nonparametric Approach in Adaptive Control and Decision making in Non-Stationary Environment and Guidance, Control and Estimation Theory.</p>

<p>I have Masters degree in Aerospace engineering from Indian Institue of Science Bangalore. I was part of Indian Space research Organization (ISRO) as Scientist/Engineer â€˜SDâ€™ at ISRO-Satellite Center Bangalore (now URSC) for 8 years before leaving for my PhD at UIUC!</p>
